## 💡 Working Principle

### NE555 Timer IC
- The NE555 is configured in **astable mode**, meaning it generates continuous clock pulses without external triggering.  
- The frequency of these pulses is determined by the resistor (R1 = 10kΩ) and capacitor (C1 = 30µF).  
- These pulses form a square wave that is used to drive the counter IC.  

### 74HC4017 Decade Counter IC
- The 74HC4017 is a **10-output Johnson counter**.  
- Each clock pulse from the NE555 advances its active output from Q0 to Q9 in sequence.  
- Each output is connected to an LED through a current-limiting resistor.  
- This results in one LED turning on at a time, creating the chasing effect.  
- The reset pin is connected to a tactile switch, which allows restarting the sequence from Q0.  

### LED Sequence
- As the clock pulses arrive, LEDs light up one after another.  
- After the tenth LED, the counter rolls back to the first LED, repeating the sequence indefinitely.
